Random walk, testing for autocorrelation

```{r}
size = 100
e.series <- rnorm(size, mean = 0, sd = 1)
#e.series <- runif(size, min = -3, max = 3)

# Cauchy Distribution might be interesting to experiment with, as it has no higher moments and can generate some huge jumps in a random walk 
# Simulates a time series subject to massive disturbances
#e.series <- rcauchy(size, location = 0, scale = 1)


Y <- 0 #initial condition

for (i in 1:length(e.series)){
  Y <- c(Y, Y[i-1] + e.series[i])
}

plot(Y, type = "o", ylab = "Random Walk")

Y <- 0 #initial condition

for (i in 1:length(e.series)){
  Y <- c(Y, Y[i-1] + e.series[i])
}

plot(Y, type = "o", ylab = "Random Walk")
```

A conclusion from the book: for a random walk, values of Y are more and more strongly correlated at t increases (time goes by), but values of Y are less and less correlated the farther apart they are (see 1,25 = 0.2). How can this be shown graphically?

```{r}
corr.distance <- NULL



```
